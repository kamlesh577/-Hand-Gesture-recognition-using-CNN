# Hand-Gesture-recognition-using-Deep learning:

The human hand gestures are detected and recognized using convolutional neural networks (CNN) classification approach. This process flow consists of hand region of interest segmentation using mask image, fingers segmentation, normalization of segmented finger image and finger recognition using CNN classifier.
